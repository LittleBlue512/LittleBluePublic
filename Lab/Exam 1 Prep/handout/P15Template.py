Write a program to calculate a lasting duration of a mobile phone battery.
Ask a user for battery energy storage (in Wh),
the phone average power consumptions (in mW) in idle
and in normal operation,
then calculate estimate duration time the battery will last in each mode,
and report the results.
Note: 1 W = 1000 mW;
(Energy Wh) = (Average Power in W) * (Operating time in hr)
